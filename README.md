# AdvancedComputers Lua-J
This is a fork of Lua-J with changes for the AdvancedComputers mod to make it more convenient for us to work with it, as well as to add new features.

### What's changed?
- Refactor deprecated code
- Added UTF-8 support
- Switched to Gradle

### Usage
No. I don't recommend using this library by you, as it is customized for the needs of the AdvancedComputers mod, and using it by other people will cause problems, as the API is not even commented out.
